# My_Keras_like_library
My first Neural Network from scratch using just numpy (used keras just for MNIST dataset) which I tried to make it as general as possible, you can add any number of Dense layers and nodes just like keras

### Get started
To get started just run, in terminal:<br>
` python my_NN2.py`
